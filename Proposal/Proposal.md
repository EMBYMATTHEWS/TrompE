**Instrument Name:**  
Trompe

**Description and Implementation:**  
Trompe combines a barometric pressure sensor with I2C (SCL/SDA connections) to accurately measure breath pressure through my script mappings whihc chops the readings down to a decent level for volume gain control over a 0-127 midi signal. It features a custom-made button pad(roughly crafted by me and some switches) with seven primary note buttons and separate controls for sharp and flat to allow for common scales to be easily played. The sensor's accuracy is enhanced by a 3D-printed casing, designed to optimize airflow and pressure detection. This setup not only allows for solid control over musical expression but also offers digital connectivity for further sound manipulation and recording.

**Good Outcome Deliverable:**

- Functional barometric pressure sensor integrated with breath input.
- Seven-note button pad with responsive touch for accurate note playing.
- Separate buttons for sharp and flat adjustments.
- Basic digital output of note sounds reflecting dynamic changes based on breath pressure.

**Better Outcome Deliverable:**

- Enhanced sensitivity and accuracy of the pressure sensor.
- decent/fully encased design
- Octave toggle
**Best Outcome Deliverable:**

- Touchpad modwheel? Screen on the side with touchpad?
- Integration with digital synthesis and processing through a teensy
- Robust design of the 3D-printed casing for enhanced durability and improved aesthetic appeal.

**Next Steps and Skill Development:**  
The next steps involve finalizing the design of the 3D-printed casing to ensure maximum efficiency in sensor performance. I will prototype the button pad to refine the tactile feedback and responsiveness. Developing the software interface for real-time data processing and sound modulation is crucial. Additional skills required include advanced knowledge in digital signal processing, experience with 3D modeling and printing, and proficiency in app development for musical applications. Research will focus on modern sensor technologies, effective digital sound synthesis methods, and user interface design principles for musical instruments.
